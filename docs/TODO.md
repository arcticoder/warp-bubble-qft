# TODO — Remaining Items (warp-bubble-qft)

**Status**: All programmatic consolidation and verification tasks complete as of 2026-01-24. Remaining items require external processes or GitHub UI access.

## Pending External Actions

### Org Transfer Checklist

- [ ] Update GitHub repository settings when moving to DawsonInstitute org:
  - Suggested topics: `loop-quantum-gravity`, `warp-drive`, `quantum-field-theory`, `computational-physics`, `verification-framework`
  - Description: "Verification framework for LQG-enhanced warp bubble optimizations with reproducible computational methods"
  - **Requires**: GitHub organization admin access

### Publication Workflow

- [ ] Peer review (internal, then arXiv submission)
  - **Status**: External process, pending org transfer
  - **Prerequisites**: Final manuscript approval from Dawson Institute

- [ ] Prepare supplementary materials (code archive, data repository)
  - **Status**: Post-publication task
  - **Dependencies**: arXiv acceptance, DOI assignment

## Optional Enhancements

### F3) Visualization enhancements

- [ ] (Optional) Add a stability summary plot (λ per edge case) if 3D checks are enabled.
  - Low priority; current visualizations (§3 figures 1-7) sufficient for manuscript

**Note**: All completed items have been moved to `docs/COMPLETED_TASKS.md`. See that file for full provenance and implementation details.
