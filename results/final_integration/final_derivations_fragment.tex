\section{Enhancement Combination Model (Heuristic)}

We report enhancement factors $F_i$ (cavity, squeezing, multi-bubble) from the pipeline.
Under an independence assumption, the combined effective factor is
\[
  \eta = \prod_i F_i.
\]

Optionally, a synergy correction can be reported as a heuristic parameterization:
\[
  \eta_{\mathrm{eff}} = \eta(1+S),\qquad S = \sum_{i<j} \gamma_{ij}.
\]

A corresponding effective energy-density scaling can be written (heuristically) as
\[
  \rho_{\mathrm{eff}} = \rho_0 \prod_i \frac{1}{F_i}\,\exp\!\left(\sum_{i<j} \gamma_{ij}\right).
\]

\paragraph{Notes.}
These are reporting models used for computational bookkeeping; they are not derived
from first-principles QFT on a warp background.
