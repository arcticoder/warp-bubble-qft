   - Result: Base feasibility ratio increases from 0.87 to 1.02

2. ITERATIVE ENHANCEMENT CONVERGENCE TO UNITY
   - Iteration 1: Base toy model = 0.87
   - Iteration 2: + LQG corrections = 2.00

   - Advanced configuration: Polymer LQG + Q=10⁶ + r=1.0 + N=4 → R=56.68

5. PRACTICAL ENHANCEMENT ROADMAPS AND Q-FACTOR ESTIMATES
   - Phase 1 (2-3 years): Q ≥ 10⁴, r ≥ 0.3, N = 2 → R = 5.24
   - Phase 2 (5-7 years): Q ≥ 10⁵, r ≥ 0.5, N = 3 → R = 15.26
   - Phase 3 (10-15 years): Q ≥ 10⁶, r ≥ 1.0, N = 4 → R = 56.68
